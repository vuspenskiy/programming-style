  // Let's conclude with one larger example, to show how quickly program can get out of hand,

  // Held at arm's length, this program looks pretty impressive.
  // The is a large assortment of data declarations, followed by a computation
  // that is evidently complex enough to warrant a sub-procedure `out`.
  // Declarations are neatly aligned, and the executable statements are staggered
  // so as to indicate several levels of control nesting. There are text strings
  // to suggest the intent of the program, and mnemonic identifiers

  // Closer inspection, however, shows quite the opposite.

  // Each output message is used only once, and would be better placed in the
  // `Console.println` call itself. The first to messages can be even combined.
  // The purpose of the assignment `m = 1.00 / k` is unclear. Does it defend
  // against some mysterious conversion? Is it to convey geometrical insight?
  // Or does the programmer worry that computers divide more slowly than they multiply?
  // Efficiency cannot be of grave importance anyway, not when the code contains
  //              area1 = 0.50 * m * (2.00 * l)
  // We can now remove all variable declarations, so it is easier to see the underlying structure.
  // Variable `i`, it is labouriously kept equal to `j` so that `out` could be called
  // at the end of the last iteration. Clearly, `out` could be used just after inner loop is terminated,
  // it is better to inline it though, as it is used just once. The structure simplifies remarkably.
  // Now we can see that the summing variable `area` is supposed to be initialized
  // at the beginning of each loop on `k`, it is much better practice than clearing it
  // at the end of each iteration, especially from a remote procedure.
  // This procedure `out` is changing `area` and reading 'lmts', destroying modularity referring to
  // seamingly local variables in unexpected places, is an invitation to future bugs.
